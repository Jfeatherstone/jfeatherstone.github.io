    <h1>Motivation</h1>

    <p class="w3-padding-16">Granular materials comprise a large group of systems that are made of lots of individual, athermal grains. Their dynamics are strongly influenced by dissipative particle-particle interactions, of which friction is a very important example.</p>

    <div class="w3-content w3-center" style="max-width: 400px">
        <img src="images/squeezing_particles_0.png" width=80% height=auto>
    </div>

    <p class="w3-padding-16">Even though the influence of friction extends far beyond granular materials, we still have yet to put forth a complete description of its mechanism -- or mechanisms. Such an understanding would be fantastically important in both academic and industrial contexts, especially when it comes to understanding frictional failure.</p>

    <div class="w3-content w3-center" style="max-width: 400px">
        <img src="images/squeezing_particles_1.png" width=80% height=auto>
    </div>

    <p class="w3-padding-16">The simplest, and most widely known, model of friction is the one-parameter Coulomb law<sup>1</sup>: when the ratio of tangential to normal force acting at a contact exceeds a certain value, the contact yields, or fails.</p>

    <p class="w3-padding-16">While this simple model generally works when you zoom out (literally or metaphorically) on a system, there are other types of friction that are only captured by more complex models. For example, when objects have rotational freedom, we have to think about rolling friction<sup>2</sup>, and if we don't restrict ourselves to solid systems, we must consider fluid friction<sup>3</sup>.</p>

    <p class="w3-padding-16">Our work looks to shed some light on the difference between sliding and rolling friction in a granular system, especially as particles locally rearrange, undergoing constant build up and release of interparticle stresses.</p>

        <p>In our 2D system, photoelastic disks are driven through a constrictive gap of set width, during which we observe the build up and release of stress on the particles.</p>

        <h1 class="w3-center">The Analysis</h1>

        <p>When describing our granular system, there are three fundamental things we want to know:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>How are the particles moving?</li>
            <li>How are the particles rotating?</li>
            <li>What forces are acting on the particles?</li>
        </ol>

        <p>We can source all three of these descriptors from images taken of our system; we'll go through how we understand and quantify each one in the sections below!</p>

        <h3 class="w3-left-align w3-padding-16">Linear Motion</h3>

        <p>To understand how a particle is moving, we need to know where the particle is located at any given time. We choose our particles to be circles (or rather, disks) which makes it very easy to track their centers as the system evolves.</p>

        <p>We use a convolutional tracking technique<sup>5</sup>, which quantifies how likely it is that a circle is centered at each point. This works extraordinarily well, no doubt in part due to the fact that we use very high resolution images, to the point that we can track the particles even to sub-pixel accuracy!</p>


        <h3 class="w3-left-align w3-padding-16">Rotational Motion</h3>

        <p>Tracking the rotational motion of particles is a little harder than linear motion, since our particles are circularly symmetric. To track rotations, we need some artifact of the particles that does <b>not</b> have rotational symmetry, a candidate for which is not immediately obvious, at least to the human eye.</p>

        <p>Do you see anything below that differs between the images of the same particle at two different times?</p>

        <div class="w3-content w3-center w3-padding-16" style="max-width: 800px">
            <img src="images/angular_conv_cropped.png" width=95% height=auto>
        </div>

        <p>The solution here lies in something that might otherwise be considered noise in the images: the speckle pattern on the bottom of each particle. This pattern, an artifact of the method by which the particles are created, is not only unique, but anisotropic.</p>

        <p>We can identify the relative rotation between any two frames by rotating one image until the two speckle patterns line up with each other. You might expect that this would be a rather weak signal, scarcely better than the minor differences in lighting across the system, but in fact it is so strong we can easily track the rotational motion of all of our particles!</p>

        <div class="w3-content w3-center w3-padding-16" style="max-width: 800px">
            <img src="images/angular_conv_test.png" width=100% height=auto>
        </div>

        <p>The movie below demonstrates the results of this rotational tracking, overlaid on the raw images.</p>

            <img src="images/particle_orientation.gif" width=90% height=auto>
        </div>

        <h3 class="w3-left-align w3-padding-16">Contact Forces</h3>

        <p>Lastly, we would like to know what forces are acting on each particle, so we can differentiate normal from tangential components, calculate coefficients of friction from the Coulomb model, and identify when and where we should look for slips.</p>

        <p>The key here is to make our particles from materials that demonstrate <i>photoelasticity</i><sup>4,6</sup>, or stress-dependent optical properties. Given the right lighting, this visually distinguishes regions of high force from those with low forces, producing patterns like the one below.</p>

        <div class="w3-content w3-center w3-padding-16" style="max-width: 600px">
            <img src="images/pe_response.png" width=90% height=auto>
        </div>
       
        <p>The hard part comes from turning these images into force magnitudes, positions, and contact angles, which we need to make any quantitative observations. We build on previous methods<sup>4</sup> that make use of an analytic description of these photoelastic responses and non-linear optimization techniques to achieve this. In particular, our developments make the technique much more sensitive to small tangential forces, which can otherwise be very difficult to detect in the shadows of the larger, normal components.</p>

        <h1 class="w3-center">The Results</h1>

        <p>Given our understanding of how our particles move (both linearly and rotationally) and what forces are acting on them, we now want to understand qualitatively what this means as our system evolves.</p>

        <p>First and foremost, we see quite a bit of heterogeneity within our individual trials, each of which tend to roughly fit into a few different categories.</p>

        <p>The first type we enumerate is characterized by continuous, smooth motion of the central particle. We plot below the driving force on the central particle (ie. the force between the central particle and its hinder particle), the velocity of the central particle, and the rotational orientation of the central particle.</p>

        <div class="w3-content w3-center w3-padding-16" style="max-width: 800px">
            <img src="images/creep.png" width=90% height=auto>
        </div>

        <p>While there are minor fluctuations in all three curves, there is nothing that we would identify as a discrete slip event (taking into account the error bars, shown as the shaded regions on each plot). This trial demonstrates <i>creep</i> behavior<sup>7</sup>.

        <p>We can also examine the same quantities for a trial that demonstrates a discrete slip event (indicated by the dashed line), falling into the <i>stick-slip</i><sup>8</sup> category.</p>

        <div class="w3-content w3-center w3-padding-16" style="max-width: 800px">
            <img src="images/slip.png" width=90% height=auto>
        </div>

        <p>We have quite a bit more to talk about here, since all three descriptors demonstrate some artifact around the time of slip. The drop in force is how we identify these slip events in the first place, as it indicates that the resistance the particle is facing has suddenly dropped. This is corroborated by the velocity profile, which shows a momentary increase in the speed of the particle as it slips, which intuitively makes sense.</p>

        <p>The unintuitive -- and therefore, the most interesting -- artifact is the reflection of angular velocity at the slip point: the particle begins to rotate in the opposite direction to the previous rotational motion. We can show that this is a consistent effect by examining other trials that demonstrate slip events, like the one below, within which we can see the same three artifacts.</p>

        <div class="w3-content w3-center w3-padding-16" style="max-width: 800px">
            <img src="images/slip_2.png" width=90% height=auto>
        </div>

        <p>Because a circular object can only roll without slipping at (at most) a single contact at any given time, this reversal is an indication that a contact over which the central particle was previously rolling is now sliding, and another contact is now rolling. This slip represents the transition, at a specific contact, from rolling to sliding behavior, and the opposite transition for another contact.</p>

        <p>We note that even when the particle is rolling, there is likely still some sliding behavior, but this suggests a veritable transition in the <i>dominant</i> mechanism of friction at a contact.</p>

        <h1 class="w3-center">Beyond The Results</h1>

        <p>Our motivation for performing this experiment is to better understand how local regions of a macroscopic system evolve, by creating a system for which we can access the particle-scale dynamics. We have done this in our quantification of the individual contact forces, linear velocity, and rotational motion.</p>

        <p>We then zoom back out to characterize how those microscopic measurements inform the macroscopic system dynamics, providing insight into how particles make use of both linear and rotational degrees of freedom to rearrange efficiently. In particular, we demonstrate the interplay between two mechanisms of friction by showing when sliding friction overtakes rolling friction (and vice versa) as the dominant dissipative contribution at a given contact.</p>

        <p>This interplay of different mechanisms emphasizes the importance of going beyond a singly-inclusive model of friction when performing numerical simulations or modeling experimental systems.</p>

        <p>We recognize that identifying transitions in the way we have done here is only possible in systems that demonstrate discrete slip events. In the future, we look to understand what system properties influence the presence (or lack thereof) of these events on the particle-scale. Does modulating the gap size -- implying a change in the packing fraction of the emulated macroscopic system -- have a significant effect on whether the system continuously creeps or discretely slips? Does particle stiffness -- implying a change in the degree to which elastic energy is stored in the system -- have any such impact?</p>

        <p>We look forward to finding out!</p>
